            >"Your BMI is a measurement of your body weight based on your height
            and weight. Although your BMI does not actually “measure” your
            percentage of body fat, it is a useful tool to estimate a healthy
            body weight based on your height. Due to its ease of measurement and
            calculation, it is the most widely used diagnostic indicator to
            identify a person’s optimal weight depending on his height. Your BMI
            “number” will inform you if you are underweight, of normal weight,
            overweight, or obese. However, due to the wide variety of body
            types, the distribution of muscle and bone mass, etc., it is not
            appropriate to use this as the only or final indication for
            diagnosis." </i
